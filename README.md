# Twin Peaks GIF Search

## Welcome to my Twin Peaks GIF Search page!

### The point of this project was to practice my new-learned skills with API's & AJAX


* I used Giphy's API to create a GIF search with buttons that are populated onto the page from an array using jQuery
* I included an input box that a user can use to add more character buttons to the page
* The buttons dynamically produce 10 character gifs including a parental rating
* The page is mobile responsive to add compatability across all screen sizes including mobile devices
